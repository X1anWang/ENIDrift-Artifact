# Artifact for paper #207 ENIDrift: A Fast and Adaptive Ensemble System for Network Intrusion Detection under Real-world Drift

# Artifact summary
ENIDrift is a fast and adaptive ensemble system for network intrusion detection under real-world drift. The system has three components: an incremental packet-to-vector feature extraction module (iP2V), a performance-and-stability-considered sub-classifier generation module, and an ensemble update module. This artifact contains the implementation of ENIDrift and scripts to run the experiments of this work.
